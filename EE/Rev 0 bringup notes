POWER PCB BRINGUP NOTES

blower turned on during power on
	need pulldowns on inputs to U1 (2x 10k)
probably could also use pulldowns on the outputs of U1
When connecting the UI board to PWR header, realized that the PWR connector was reversed.
	Flip PWR connector on POWER PCB
	Make a standard: pin 1 = GND for power connectors
Let's label GND and +12V on the power input
Let's put labels for the testpoints, if we are going to have testpoints, or can just remove them
slowed down because of bent pin on tiny power connector - move to bigger cheaper connectors
